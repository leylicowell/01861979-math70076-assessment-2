  abstract={The coastal area of Guangdong Province is one of the most developed regions in China. It is also often under severe risk of storm surges, as one of the few regions in China which are seriously threatened by storm surges. Based on the data of storm surges in the study area in the past 30 years, the return periods of 18 tide stations for storm surge are calculated separately. Using the spatial analysis technology of ArcGIS, combined with the topography data of the study area, the submerged scope for storm surge in the coastal area of Guangdong Province is determined, and the hazard assessment is carried out. According to the view of systematic point, this article quotes the result of vulnerability assessment which was done by the author in the previous research. Based on the hazard evaluation and vulnerability evaluation, risk assessment of storm surges in the study region is done, and the risk zoning map is drawn. According to the assessment, Zhuhai, Panyu and Taishan are classified as the highest risk to storm surges in Guangdong Province; Yangdong, Yangjiang and Haifeng are in higher risk to storm surges; Dongguan, Jiangmen, Baoan and Huidong are in middle risk to storm surges; Zhongshan, Enping, Shanwei, Huiyang, Longgang and Shenzhen are in lower risk of storm surges; Guangzhou, Shunde and Kaiping are in the lowest risk to storm surges. This study builds a complete process for risk assessment of storm surges. It reveals the risk of storm surges in the coastal cities, and it would guide the land use of coastal cities in the future and provide scientific advices to the government for the prevention and mitigation of storm surge disaster. It has important theoretical and practical significance. Copyright Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2013},

    abstract = { Annualized hurricane-related losses in the United States are in the billions of dollars. The majority of the coastal population lives in buildings prone to hurricanes, which could result in wind damage (due to high wind and/or wind-driven rain infiltration) and water damage (due to storm surge and waves or freshwater flooding), which are typically insured by separate entities. In the event that a structure is subjected to damage from both wind and water hazards, the proper allocation of damage for insurance purposes is challenging because wind and water vulnerability are often assessed with separate models. The challenge is how to combine the results of these different models and properly assign damage causation. This paper proposes a methodology for the assessment of multihazard vulnerability for implementation in the Florida Public Hurricane Loss Model, in which the damage from each hazard (wind and rain, storm surge, and freshwater inundation) is calculated separately. An engineering approach in conjunction with hazard information (intensity, timing) and statistical methods is utilized to allocate damage. }

abstract = {Abstract Despite its high tropical cyclone (TC) density, the Eastern North Pacific (ENP) basin has received relatively little research attention on landfall variability. This study investigates the climatological seasonal cycle and interannual variability of TC landfalls in the ENP. We find that the basin is characterized by a bimodal distribution of landfalls, with peaks in June and September–October. Using a composite analysis of high and low landfall years, we show that this distribution is primarily driven by landfall probability rather than genesis. The absence of landfalls during July is due to enhanced easterlies from the Caribbean Low-Level Jet entering the ENP through gaps in the Americas Cordillera. High landfall years feature enhanced easterly wind reversals from a northward-shifted Intertropical Convergence Zone. These additional steering winds drive hurricanes ashore in the vulnerable region of southwest Mexico. This study provides valuable insights for improving TC landfall forecasts and preparedness in the region.},

abstract = {Analysis of the statistical relationship between annual U.S. hurricane activity and the El Niño-Southern oscillation (ENSO) is performed. The legitimacy of considering annual U.S. hurricane counts as a Poisson process is checked. Then, Poisson regression is used to model the ENSO-U.S. hurricane connection. A bivariate regression model verifies a significant negative correspondence between tropical Pacific sea-surface temperature (SST) and U.S. hurricane activity. When equatorial SSTs are cold, U.S. hurricanes are more likely. Secular changes to the ENSO-U.S. hurricane relationship are examined using moving regressions. A nonlinear downward trend in the relationship's strength is evident. Variations in sea-level pressures over the extra-tropical North Atlantic Ocean during months immediately prior to the hurricane season provide an explanation for a portion of this secular variability. Atmospheric synoptic conditions associated with the North Atlantic oscillation (NAO) result in hurricanes tracking parallel to southern latitudes en route to the United States.},

	abstract = {Numerous Atlantic basin tropical cyclones have recently developed prior to the official start of hurricane season, including several pre-season landfalls in the continental United States. Pre-season and early-season tropical cyclones disproportionately affect populated landmasses, often producing outsized precipitation impacts. Here we show a significant trend towards earlier onset of tropical cyclone activity in the North Atlantic basin, with threshold dates of the first three percentiles of accumulated cyclone energy shifting earlier at a rate exceeding five days decade−1 since 1979, even correcting for biases in climatology due to increased detection of short-lived storms. Initial threshold dates of continental United States named storm landfalls have trended earlier by two days decade−1 since 1900. The trend towards additional pre-season and early-season activity is linked to spring thermodynamic conditions becoming more conducive for tropical cyclone formation. Genesis potential index value increases in the western Atlantic basin are primarily driven by warming ocean temperatures.},
